<p> Lawliet (Japanese: エル・ローライト, Hepburn: Eru Rōraito),[1] known mononymously as L, is a fictional character and the main
antagonist in the manga series Death Note, created by Tsugumi Ohba and Takeshi Obata. He is an enigmatic, mysterious,
and highly-esteemed international consulting detective whose true identity and background is kept a secret. He
communicates with law enforcement agencies only through his equally inexplicable handler/assistant, Watari, who serves
as his official liaison with the authorities. Though his past is shrouded in mystery, he has gained a reputation as
arguably the world's greatest detective/criminal profiler.</p>

<p>Throughout the series, he observes and spies on the activities of the series' protagonist, Light Yagami, a high school
genius. L attempts to expose Light as the infamous serial killer "Kira", who is responsible for massacring high-profile
criminals worldwide through apparently supernatural means. As the series progresses, the psychological mind-game between
L and Light intensifies, and each becomes bent on uncovering the other's true identity through a series of intricate
ploys and schemes. He serves as an ideological and visual foil to Light.</p>
